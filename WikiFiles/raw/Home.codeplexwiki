*Project Description*
This project hosts the source and binaries for an extended Guid layer that can create *version 5 Guid's*. If you ever find the need for a Guid based on an arbitrary string given a work field (i.e. name space) this is the Guid creator for you. 

If you ever need to know what *version a particular Guid* has, this stucture can help you with that as well.
